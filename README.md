Calculate Pvalue Example:
=========================



Description:
============
Implement a function that computes the p-value to test the hypothesis that the mean of one dataset is equal to the mean of another dataset. The function should take as inputs the two datasets and the significance level, and outputs the p-value in addition to the boundaries of the acceptance region. The significance level is 0.05.



Deliverables:
==============
1. Python code.
2. The histogram of datasets (3-1) and (3-2).
3. The histogram of datasets (3-1) and (3-3).
